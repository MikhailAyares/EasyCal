# EasyCal

EasyCal is a desktop application for tracking daily food, and nutrition intake. It allows users to add foods, log meals, and view daily summaries of calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. The app is built with Python, PyQt5 for the user interface, and SQLite for data storage.

To make logging even easier, EasyCal includes a pre-populated food database. This database contains a list of common foods and their nutritional values, so you don’t have to manually enter every food you eat. You can also add new foods to the database at any time through the app’s interface.
